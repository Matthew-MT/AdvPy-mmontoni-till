## Project 1: Hangman
- Project 0 completed. (10 pts)
- Chooses a random word from a list imported from the text file words.txt. There are at least 20 words. (10 pts)
- Program validates user's input to ensure it's one character long and is only a letter. (10 pts)
- Program can be run simply by typing "python main.py" if python 3 is installed. (10 pts)
- Bells and wistles: Game displays the word that is being guessed in an intuitive fashion, and shows how far the user is to reaching hangman by an ascii graphic. All features are intuitive, and entertaining (I even struggled to guess the words I put in the list!) (10 pts)
- Game gives user the option to quit or continue when game is over. (10 pts)
- Manual testing performed, no logical flaws found, and no errors either. Game runs as expected. (35 pts)
- Screenshots of testing taken and put in the folder alongside program files. (5 pts)
- Bonus: Game displays number of games won and lost, as well as win percentage, when asking player whether to continue. (10 pts)
- Total points: 110
- Note: I intended to make this be a GUI using tkinter (or PyGame), but my car broke down and distracted me from doing so unfortunately. So instead I opted for CLI.

## Project 3: Integer Calculator
- Uses GUI interface to display calculator screen, with buttons and an input box as GUI elements for the user to interact with.
- Allows the user to do a number of different operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square roots.
- Displays answer in input box, allowing user to continue performing operations if needed.
- More operations can easily be added, by simply creating the operation function and adding the button that calls it.
- How to run:
    - Open terminal, and navigate to the folder containing main.py.
    - Run main.py using `python3 main.py` in the command line.
    - A window will pop up with the user interface fully initialized, you may now use the calculator.
    - When done, simply close window.
